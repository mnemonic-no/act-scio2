Program to check the feed output directory of feed_downloader.py
Any downloaded content not found in the cache is handled.
The .meta files associated with the .html files from the feed download is
kept to preserve information about source and original titles as well as
feed time and date stamps.
This files builds a document understood by SCIOs 'doc' work queue.
This utility is not meant to handle the files downloaded from links _in_ the
feed as these document does not share any of the meta-data associated with
the feed entries. These files need to be handled separately (using SCIOs own
submit utility.
